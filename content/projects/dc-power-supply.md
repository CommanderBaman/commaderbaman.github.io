This project was done as part of the course EE113 at IITB. It takes in AC Power and outputs DC voltages at +12V, -12V and 5V with respect to a common ground. It uses a 15-0-15 center tapped transformer to convert the higher voltages into lower voltages that can be handled easily.

The input to the system is supply to our homes. The circuit uses a full bridge rectifier along with a capacitor filter to maintain a constant DC output. There are four output terminals - one at ground, one at +12V, one at -12V and last at +5V. LEDs are used to check if the circuit is working or not.

The final circuit was implemented on a Perforated Circuit board (PCB).
