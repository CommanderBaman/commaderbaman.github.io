Flip food is a simple Django application built to simulate a complete buying and selling market platform.

By entering some required information like name, address, profile photo etc. any one can become a user. Facilities are only activated after they verify their account. The current verification method is clicking on a link sent on their emails.

  <div class="image-section">

    <img class="image-2" src="/images/projects/flip-food/registeration-page.jpg" alt="Registeration page of Flip Food application"/>
  </div>
  <figcaption class="image-2-caption">
    Login and Registeration pages for the user
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Users can put up their items for sale, all of which is visible on the main page.

Pagination is used to display a portion of all items present on the site.

Cart feature is enabled so that users can buy multiple objects at the same time.

  <figcaption class="image-1-caption">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

Bootstrap was used to design a responsive User Interface.

A demo version of Paypal is also integrated to facilitate demo payments (as this is not a real market, for now).
